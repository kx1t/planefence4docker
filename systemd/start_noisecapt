# START_noisecapt - a Bash shell script to run noisecapt in a loop
# This script is invoked by the SystemD service that keeps noisecapt up and running
# 
# The reasons for using SystemD over CRON are several, and include
# easy of use and management
#
# To start/stop/install noisecapt, do the following:
#
# 1 Base enablement of the noisecapt Service from your GitHub cache:
# 	sudo cp ~/git/noisecapt/service/noisecapt.service /lib/systemd/system/
# 	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# 	sudo systemctl enable noisecapt
#
# 2 Manually starting or stopping the service:
#	sudo systemctl start noisecapt
#	sudo systemctl stop noisecapt
#
# 3 Ensuring that the service is reloaded on reboot / stopping it from reloading on reboot:
#	sudo systemctl enable noisecapt
#	sudo systemctl disable noisecapt
#
# 4 Checking the status of the noisecapt service:
#	systemctl status noisecapt
#
# 5 Looking at the noisecapt logs:
#	tail -n100 -f /tmp/noisecapt.log
