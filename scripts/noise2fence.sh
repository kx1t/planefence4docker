# If you want to read a remote file, please do the following:
# ON THIS MACHINE, as user 'pi':
# - if it doesn't already exist, create ~/.ssh and cd into that directory
# - if ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub doesn't already exist, then type this command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "pi@PIAWARE"
# - Copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the remote machine (replace 10.0.0.161 with the IP or DNS of the remote machine): scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@10.0.0.161:/tmp/id_rsa.pub
# ON THE REMOTE MACHINE, as user 'pi':
# - if it doesn't already exist, create ~/.ssh and cd into that directory
# - Add the file you copied to your authorized keys: cp /tmp/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ; rm /tmp/id_rsa.pub
# - make sure you set the right permissions:
#   chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
#   chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Last, configure the REMOTELOG parameter with the username and IP address of the remote account:
#
# If you do NOT want remote access, simply comment out the REMOTELOG line below.
