# PLANETWEET - a Bash shell script to render heatmaps from modified sock30003
# heatmap data
#
# Usage: ./planetweet.sh
#
# Note: this script is meant to be run as a daemon using SYSTEMD
# If run manually, it will continuously loop to listen for new planes
#
# This script is distributed as part of the PlaneFence package and is dependent
# on that package for its execution.
